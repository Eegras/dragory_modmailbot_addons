# dragory_modmailbot_addons
Addons for Dragory's modmailbot for Discord - https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot

# Installation Instructions
Unless otherwise noted in the comments of the script, just put the .js in a directory called "plugins" at the root of the modmailbot directory ( as a child to "src" and "config.ini" ).  

You must also tell modmailbot to load it by adding a line in "config.ini" like this:    
`plugins[] = ./plugins/setnick.js`

Note: One plugin per line.
